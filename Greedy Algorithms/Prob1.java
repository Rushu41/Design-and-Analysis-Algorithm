// âœ… Problem 1: Activity Selection Problem
// ðŸ§  Question
// You are given n activities with their start and finish times. Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.

// ðŸ“¥ Input
// An array start[] of size n representing start times.

// An array end[] of size n representing finish times.

// ðŸŽ¯ Goal
// Return the maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be performed.

// ðŸ’¡ Explanation (Greedy Strategy)
// The greedy strategy here is:

// Sort the activities by their finish time.

// Select the activity with the earliest finish time first.

// Then, skip all overlapping activities and pick the next one that starts after the last selected activity ends.

// This works because selecting activities with the earliest finish time leaves room for more future activities.
